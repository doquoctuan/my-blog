# High-Performance Computing

## Data Management & Transfer

* AWS Direct Connect: Move Gb/s of data to the cloud, over a private secure network
    
* Snowball & Snowmobile: Move PB of data to the cloud
    
* AWS DataSync: Move large amounts of data between on-premise and S3, EFS, and FSx for Windows
    

## Compute and Networking

* EC2 Instances:
    
    * CPU optimized, GPU optimized
        
    * Spot Instances, Spot Fleets for cost savings + Auto Scaling
        
* EC2 Placement Groups: Cluster for good network performance
    

### Networking

* EC2 Enhanced Networking (SR-IOV)
    
    * Higher bandwidth, higher PPS (packet per second), lower latency
        
    * Option 1: Elastic Network Adapter (EFA) up to 100 Gbps
        
    * Option 2: Intel 82599 VF up to 10 Gbps - LEGACY
        
* Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
    
    * Improved ENA for HPC, only works for Linux
        
    * Great for inter-node communications, tightly coupled workloads
        
    * Leverages Message Passing Interface standard
        
    * Bypasses the underlying Linux OS to provide low-latency, reliable transport
        

## Storage

* Instance-attached storage:
    
    * EBS: scale up to 256,000 IOPS with io2 Block Express
        
    * Instance Store: scale to millions of IOPS, linked to EC2 instance, low latency
        
* Network storage:
    
    * **S3:** large blob, not a file system
        
    * **EFS:** scale IOPS based on total size, or use provisioned IOPS
        
    * **FSx for Lustre:**
        
        * HPC-optimized distributed file system, millions of IOPS
            
        * Backed by S3
            

## Automation and Orchestration

* **AWS Batch**
    
    * AWS Batch supports multi-node parallel jobs, which enables the running of single jobs that span multiple EC2 instances
        
    * Easily schedule jobs and launch EC2 instances accordingly
        
* **AWS ParallelCluster**
    
    * Open-source cluster management tool to deploy HPC on AWS
        
    * Configure with text files
        
    * Automate the creation of VPC, Subnet, Cluster type, and instance types
        
    * **Ability to enable EFA on the cluster (improves network performance)**
